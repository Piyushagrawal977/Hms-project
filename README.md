# Hms-project

This project is based on the concept of a “HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” With the help of concepts of classes, objects,  and databases, this project is capable of keeping records of the doctors and the patients that have visited the hospital, before going with the study of program code, it is necessary that one understands the pre-conditions that have been assumed for making the program simple, more presentable and easier to understand. These are as follows All the doctors and patients have unique IDs. Variable for storing the values for age and gender are char, so age and gender are entered in this way value of age < > years gender < > This project just gives a simple idea of how a record of various doctors and patients can be kept in hospital. With better knowledge of Java, and MySQL, and the use of more functions, the program can be made more user-friendly and practically applicable. In its present form, this project just gives a reflection of how management may be done in an organization such as a hospital with the help of simple functions for adding, diagnosing, updating the records, and many more.
